			<h1> FAQs</h1>
			<h4>Is a visa required to visit India?</h4>

			<div class="answer">
				<p>In the hot Indian summers we recommend light cotton tops, shorts and trousers. If you are travelling to any of India’s national parks, remember to pack some long-sleeved cotton tops for game drives. In the cold winter months, temperature may drop drastically, therefore warm clothing would be essential. As Indian landscape is diverse we advise to include the clothes by taking care of the weather and temperature of the area on the particular season. Besides, when visiting religious monuments and shrines you may need to dress formally, so both men and women should pack some long skirts and pants.</p>
			</div>

			<h4>Are vaccinations required?</h4>

			<div class="answer">
				<p>You may need to take malaria prophylactics or have some other vaccines like polio, typhoid, and so on before you travel. But before you plan something we strongly recommend that first you visit your doctor at least four weeks before the date of the departure.For up-to-date information regarding vaccination and medical precaution should be performed before hiting the Indian street.</p>

			<h4>Do the Indians speak English?</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>Yes, English is commonly spoken throughout India. In fact, most children, particularly in the cities, learn English first in school. It is the most important language for commercial, national, and political status. Hindi is the national language and primary tongue for 40% of Indians. However, there are 21 other official languages, including Gujarati, Tamil, Punjabi and Sanskrit.</p>

			<h4>How is the clima in India?</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>India is a vast country with complex seasonal and geographical variations in climate. Generally, the best time for your holiday in India is during the months of October through to April. The Monsoon season starts in mid May and continues through to the end of August. Most of the game sanctuaries of India are closed during the Monsoon period. During the summer months of May and June, the lower plains of the South and the desert areas of the North India are very hot and either dry in the North or humid in the South, while the hills and mountain regions provide a cool sanctuary for summertime holidays. Please look at the regional weather chart in the Booking Form or check with our Travel Consultants for more detailed weather information for the particular area you will be visiting.</p>

			<h4>What do i need to know when visiting temples?</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>While visiting places of worship and mausoleums there are certain religious customs to be observed in India. As a token of respect, it is customary to remove your footwear before entering all temples. In Jain and Hindu temples leather goods such as belts, shoes and bags will not be permitted.</p>
			</div>

			<h4>What is India currency?</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>There are no restrictions on the amount of foreign currency or travellers cheques you may bring into India, provided a declaration is made in the currency declaration form given to arriving passengers. However, cash, bank notes and traveler cheques up to US $10,000 or equivalent need not be declared at the time of entry. For safety and convenience we would advise that you take the majority of your money in travellers cheques. It is advisable to change your money through authorized banks and hotels. Hotels are probably the most convenient option, as their rates are usually only a little poorer than the banks. Always keep your receipts, as you will need them at the end of your tour if you wish to convert your rupees back to your own currency. The units of Indian currency are the rupee and the paise. There are 100 paise in the rupee. Paper money comes in the denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 rupees and coins are available in 50 paise and in rupee coins of 1, 2 and 5. All major credit cards are accepted in most hotels and restaurants and government shops, as are travellers' cheques in US dollars or Sterling.</p>

			<div class="answer">
				<p>It’s best to avoid drinking the tap water. Bottled water is easily available, but it’s a good idea to check that the seal on the bottle is undamaged or not before you purchase it.
